# Exercise 5

Write a JavaScript function that calculate the shortest distance between 2 points. Takes a string of four numbers and these numbers represent two separate points on a graph known as the x-axis (horizontal axis) and y-axis (vertical axis). Each number corresponds as follows: "x1, y1, x2, y2". Calculate the distance between x and y.

- All floats fixed to 2 decimal places (e.g. 2.34).

## Example

```javascript
console.log(shortestDistance('1,1,2,1'));
// 1
console.log(shortestDistance('1,1,3,1'));
// 2
console.log(shortestDistance('-5,1,3,1'));
// 8
console.log(shortestDistance('-5,2,3,1'));
// 8.06
```
